On running the flask application on localhost:5000/pythonlogin a login API should show up.
You can either login if you are an existing user or resgister.
On logging in the home page is displayed where you can check your profile for saved credentials or add credentials to the database.
I have used MySQL databse to do so with two tables accounts which holds all the existing users and sites which holds all the credentials for every user.
