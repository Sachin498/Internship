On running the flask application on localhost:5000/pythonlogin a login API should show up.
You can either login if you are an existing user or register.
On logging in the home page is displayed where you can check your profile for saved credentials or add credentials to the database.
The passwords are hashed when entered and then cross-verified while logging in.
I have used a MySQL databse with two tables, "accounts" which holds all the existing users and "sites" which holds all the credentials for every user.
